# 🔍 DEBUGGING: Admin Dashboard Not Updating with Real Data

## Issue Identified
The admin dashboard is showing hardcoded data (6 cases) instead of real student screening data.

## 🔧 Debugging Steps Added

I've added comprehensive debugging to identify where the issue is:

### 1. Backend Debugging
- ✅ Added console logs to `processScreeningResults()` function
- ✅ Added console logs to admin dashboard overview endpoint
- ✅ Created database test script

### 2. Frontend Debugging
- ✅ Added console logs to screening submission
- ✅ Added console logs to admin data fetching

## 🚀 Next Steps to Debug

### Step 1: Test Database Contents
```bash
cd backend
node testDatabase.js
```
This will show you exactly what's in your database.

### Step 2: Test Student Screening Submission
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173/dashboard/pss`
3. Complete the comprehensive screening with HIGH scores:
   - PSS: Answer "Very Often" to most questions (score ~30+)
   - PHQ-9: Answer "Nearly every day" to most questions (score ~20+)
   - GAD-7: Answer "Nearly every day" to most questions (score ~15+)
4. Submit and watch console logs

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
Watch your backend terminal for logs starting with:
- 🔍 Processing screening results
- 👤 Found user
- 📊 Risk assessment
- 🆕 Creating new flagged case
- 💾 Flagged case saved

### Step 4: Test Admin Dashboard
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin-login`
2. Login with `admin@institution.edu` / `password123`
3. Check browser console for logs starting with:
   - 🔍 Fetching admin overview data
   - 📥 Received admin data

### Step 5: Check Backend Admin Logs
Watch backend terminal for:
- 📋 Admin dashboard overview requested
- 📊 Total screenings found
- 🚩 Total flagged cases
- 📤 Sending response

## 🎯 Expected Results

After completing a high-risk screening:
- Backend should log: "🆕 Creating new flagged case"
- Admin dashboard should show increased counts
- You should see your anonymized case in the recent cases list

## 🔍 Potential Issues to Check

1. **User Not Found**: Check if the user ID from Clerk matches database
2. **Low Risk Scores**: Ensure scores are high enough to trigger flagged case creation
3. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB connection and collections
4. **API Route Conflicts**: Check if routes are properly mounted
5. **CORS Issues**: Verify API calls are reaching the backend

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### If User Not Found:
```javascript
// Check user ID format in comprehensive screening
console.log('User ID being sent:', user?.id || user?.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress);
```

### If Scores Too Low:
Make sure to answer with high-risk responses:
- PSS: "Very Often" for most questions
- PHQ-9 & GAD-7: "Nearly every day" for most questions

### If No Database Connection:
```bash
cd backend
node testDatabase.js
```

## 📞 Test Commands

```bash
# Start backend with debugging
cd backend
npm start

# In another terminal, test database
cd backend
node testDatabase.js

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **Backend logs show**: "🆕 Creating new flagged case"  
✅ **Database test shows**: Increased flagged case count  
✅ **Admin dashboard shows**: Updated numbers and new cases  
✅ **Real-time polling works**: Dashboard updates automatically
